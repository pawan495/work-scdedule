# Work Day Scheduler 

# Overview 📖

A application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# Description 📣

The scheduler itself has time blocks for regular work hours from 9-5. You can save your task in three different times as Past, Current and Future.
You can type what ever tasks you wish to have stored and press the save button, even if you close the web browser your information will still persist.

If you want to remove a task, just delete what you have written and press save or press clear field. I used Html, CSS/Bootstrap and Jquery.
